I did email that night but it had some problems and as people told my i hadnt clearly stated that i accepted their offer so i emailed friday night and the office said they will reply on monday so i just want to verify, if they called that means im definite to be admitted if i pay fees today (monday) or is there a chance for my seat to be taken. My merit position isnt great as i didnt really care about the exam and left after attempting half the exam and got a 3000s MP. Let me know what chances for my admission as im dependent on GIKI as my last resort. Thank you!",

My focus isn‚Äôt just on helping you get **good grades**, but also on building **real problem-solving skills**.\n\n**Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll provide:**\n\n* Complete **exam-focused material** and practice questions\n* Guidance on **how to approach problems** (not just memorize solutions)\n* Tips to strengthen your **critical thinking and coding mindset**\n* Interactive teaching sessions using a **graphic tablet** for clear explanations and problem walkthroughs\n\nIn this age of AI, almost anyone can ‚Äúwrite code,‚Äù but the real difference is being able to **think logically and solve problems** and that only comes through consistent practice and the right guidance.\n\nYes, there are tons of resources online (and many are excellent), but what most students struggle with is **how to use them effectively, structure learning, and build things independently**. That‚Äôs where having a mentor/guide really makes a difference.\n\nSo, if you genuinely want to **learn, improve problem-solving, and secure good grades that will help you in the long run**, feel free to **DM me**.\n\n",

        "body": "What should you bring to GIKI\n\nWhat to Bring to GIKI\n\n\r\nEssentials List\n\n\r\nThis list is meant for things that are non-negotiable\n\n\r\n1.\tBedsheets\n\n\r\nBring at least 2 bedsheets. GIKI gives you a mattress and a mattress cover, but the bedsheets are on you.\n\n\r\n2.\tPillow Cover\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll get a pillow from GIKI, but not the cover. Bring one or two of your own.\n\n\r\n3.\tBlanket/Chadar\n\n\r\nYou will have 1 week break after mids to get stuff for Winters. No need to bring at the start. You will also need Electric Blower in winter, but November me le ana when you get mid break.\n\n\r\n4.\tToiletries\n\n\r\nThe basics like soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste. Stay clean and fresh. Can be bought from inside GIK.\n\n\r\n5.\tTowels\n\n\r\nOne hand towel and one bath towel. Using one towel for everything isn't a flex. Just bring both.\n\n\r\n6.\tWater Bottle\n\n\r\nA vacuum flask bottle is a good idea. Saves you from running to the water dispenser every time you're thirsty. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n7.\tBug Spray\n\n\r\nYou will need this. Mortein or Kingtox, your choice. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n8.\tUmbrella\n\n\r\nGet a white or silver-colored one. It‚Äôll help in both sun and rain. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n9.\tCleaning Cloth\n\n\r\nUseful when you spill tea, coffee or anything else on your desk.\n\n\r\n10.\tLaptop\n\n\r\nGo for at least an 8th gen i5 or i7 with 8GB RAM. An SSD makes a big difference if you can afford one. This is the minimum. You can go higher if you want.\n\n\r\n11.\tPhone Charger\n\n\r\nObvious but easy to forget. Don‚Äôt leave it behind.\n\n\r\n12.\tRucksack or Backpack\n\n\r\nPerfect for carrying snacks from TUC to your room without making it obvious. Also works for books if you decide to study.\n\n\r\n13.\tLaundry Basket or Bucket\n\n\r\nSomething to throw dirty clothes in. I used a bucket and washed socks in it too. Don‚Äôt use your chair for laundry or you‚Äôll have nowhere to sit. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n14.\tNail cutter\n\n\r\nNakhun kaatne ke liye yes\n\n\r\n15.\tStapler\n\n\r\nVery important. Bring a stapler, get extra pins, and keep them stocked.\n\n\r\n16.\tHangers\n\n\r\nHelps when you wake up at 7:50 for a class at 8:00. Just grab the hanged clothes, pitstop at the bathroom and rush to class.\n\n\r\n17.\tTissues\n\n\r\nUseful for all kinds of situations. You can always steal some from the mess or TUC, but better to keep your own incase you need them at night or hours when they are closed.\n\n\r\n18.\tSnacks\n\n\r\nMidnight cravings hit hard. Especially when you are studying. I personally prefer biscuits. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n19.\tPrayer Mat\n\n\r\nNamaz parhna, acha grade aye ga.\n\n\r\n20.\tPlates, Cup, Glass, Utensils, Bowl\n\n\r\nYou won‚Äôt need these in the mess, but you will in your room when you're eating something on your own. \n\n\r\n21.\tDeodorant, Body Spray or Perfume\n\n\r\nSmelling nice makes a good impression. Don't skip this.\n\n\r\n22.\tSewing Kit\n\n\r\nIf your shirt tears, you‚Äôll have to fix it yourself. A small kit will help. Ab barey honey ka time aa geya he.\n\n\r\n23.\tDetergent (Small Pack)\n\r\nIn case something spills on your clothes, you can soak them quickly and avoid stains. Laundry service is available, but it is scheduled. Your clothes will get permanent stains until he comes. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n24.\tDishwashing Items\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll need to wash your own plates and cups. Bring a sponge and dish soap. Lemon max mera hero. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n25.\tCNIC and Registration Info\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll need these during check-in and formalities. Keep them safe.\n\n\r\n26.\tScissors\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll be surprised how often these come in handy. I even used them to fix my moustache the morning of my final presentation. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n27.\tKnife\n\n\r\nCan cut fruits, salads, ropes, people (don‚Äôt cut people 0/10 move highly unrecommended, 0 tolerance policy).\n\n\r\n28.\tSlippers\n\n\r\nSo you can slip in washroom (bad joke I know). Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n29.\tClothes\n\n\r\nThere‚Äôs no Dress code at GIKI but wear proper clothes. You‚Äôre not Tarzan. Can be bought from inside GIKI but I recommend that you bring your good clothes.\n\n\r\n30.\tMirror\n\n\r\nA small personal mirror helps you check your face before heading out.\n\n\r\n31.\tCalculator\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôre doing engineering. You know why this is important. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n32.\tElectric Kettle\n\n\r\nThis will save your life. Makes noodles, tea, coffee, boiled eggs and milk. Try to get one with a wide mouth. Narrow ones can be a pain. I know people who even tried to cook food in their kettle. I don‚Äôt know if they succeeded. But it is a true partner.\n\n\r\n33.\tElectric Iron\n\n\r\nDoes your clothes have wrinkles before an important meeting? This guy will help. Also used to heat food by students. You will learn the secret ways young pupil.\n\n\r\n34.\tOnline banking\n\n\r\nGet yourself an online bank account. Giki mein boht ziada use hota hai\n\n\r\n35.\tUFONE SIM\n\n\r\nIf possible, get yourself Ufone sim. Ufone works the best in GIK, ZONG ki service aksar down hoti hai. \n\n\r\n36.\tMedicines\n\n\r\nYou can get medicines from medical center here laikin basic medicines like Panadol, brufen,  arinac, etc. waise hi honi chahiye (laikin buntiyon ki tarah nahi khani). Also if you take any instructed medicine, wo lazmi rakh lena coz there‚Äôs a chance ke wo giki se na millein.\r\n\n\n\nCopied !",

Many people also say that it has become very overcrowded now and is mostly a good university for book lovers or people who just want to study, but not for those who want a balanced social life. Since living in a hostel there for four years comes with very high fees, I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs really worth it. On the other hand, I also got admission into NUST, but only in Liberal Arts and Humanities, and I‚Äôm not sure how much scope that degree really has. So I‚Äôm confused whether it‚Äôs better to go for NUST in this field or to consider GIKI, since I‚Äôve also heard from some people that GIKI‚Äôs overall standard has gone down quite a bit. I don‚Äôt know if this is just a rumor or the reality.\n\nPlease let me know anyone any senior or an expert\n",

My father was the one who told me my first priority is your education but when the time came the story flipped. There might be few financial crisis I totally understand I refused the offer and then later on applied to IBA but unfortunately couldn't get in. I applied to giki and got accepted for bscs, my mother was in the hospital I stayed with her day and night and I just got a day to prepare for giki test despite that I managed to clear it. When the results came out can you guess what they said?( Congratulations that you got accepted but we cannot send you). I cried in front of them but nobody listened. There wasn't a single day I betrayed my parents trust even to the extent that I don't even talk to boys but I guess it was of no use. I applied to nust and got in for mechanical engineering but my father tells me this isn't the field you should pursue. Later on my least Option was left for CS I got accepted there(I will be going there now) it's a business university particularly and not even famous. Why the hell did I went through all those struggles for clearing those university tests( agar mujhay pata hota ye hona hai mere Sath main kabhi mehmag hi nahi karti). I wish if I would have gotten parents who understand me , all of my friends are going to good universities and m stuck here in hell despite being accepted. Not a single day goes without having these thoughts, nevertheless the only thought that comes to my mind from frustration is that I will not stay in that house once I graduate. They keep on telling me they love me but I guess they don't understand me. ",

It's devastating since you are the one dedicating 4 yrs of your life on to smth that will influence how you'll live the rest of your life. The parents will realise this very late (or not) but by then it will too late. You must fight for yourself or else risk losing your grip on your very own life since it was never your decision.",

You'll have to LEARN things by YOURSELF at your own PACE and TIME investment. I am not saying it as some all knowing boomer but I've been there, I've friends with same conclusions who were in that boat. \nSo stop worrying about the university and plan on how you'll make the best of this opportunity (to explore CS).\n\n2. In my perspective, CS is beautiful. It crosses over with many domains and if you're the person who likes to learn and explore, You'll learn, explore and grow a lot. You'll attain so many skills! \n\n3. It's really the only pathway which can save you from this toxic and stupid environment. All you've to do is to get good in CS, grab the opportunities, work, save and GET OUTTA HERE.\n\n4. You'll likely have to make the difficult choice of having control of your life or maintaining the family. My advice will be to remain on guard if you start going against them! Anything is possible! \n\n\nWhy CS Is the only way? Well, another way is business (if you set it up, it goes well then why would you leave it and move out of country? Also, not easy and requires capital).\nCS is all skill based, You'll be doing same stuff in any other part of the world. There's no tech difference. Most companies won't even give shit about degree if you've skills and showcase/proof of them. CS pays well, You can get good remote job, freelancing etc. \nIt's more flexible and doesn't require strict timing although you will have to work more as you've to learn so much in yours first 2yrs.",

Alhamdullilah, so coming back to it if you were in this background so  do you really think your parents would allow you to work at a coffee shop, Even if I would give my arm and leg they would never. So just shut up, stop talking nonsense and understand that not everyone has to go through financial problems but few of the students do have parents issues as well. I applied for financial aid at Habib as well, even that my father refused saying that we can afford your fees it's not a problem, he called Habib and denied them the FA and when the time came guess what he said, well I had no issue and rejected the offer and went further to apply to other universities. No child in this world would overburden their parents(no one is selfish), because this person who lives with their families knows them the best.

Now i finally can pay the fees. I am aiming for Mechanical Engineering; its closing merit is 2241. Is there a chance that i can get in GIKI for mechanical engineering? If i call them through some authorities who are a part of GIKI currently will it make it possible? I‚Äôm a lone son of a lone mother and these things have been really stressing me out. Please pray for me. Thank you! \nMay Allah bless you all and ease things for you in the coming future Ameen SumAmeen. ",

Also u cn buy them on the first day. They r available at tuc.\n- And also buy on the first day or bring from home, a three plug switch but first ask someone to share picof the socket cuz they are such that normal pugs don't fit in them and also u can't charge ur phone etc until u have it. \n- If u sleep in mid darkness bring a switch night bulb cuz their aren't any their and no place to put normal night bulbs and switch night bulbs are not available at tuc as well.

Didn‚Äôt wanna sit in-front  of the laptop all day and code. Mushkil to tha but if I had any interest I know I could have done it but absolutely abhorred it. And only the cs courses were bothering me. I was doing pretty well in maths and physics courses in fast. So I knew cs wasn‚Äôt for me hence I took admission into giki this year for ME. Look some people might be able to push themselves to do something they don‚Äôt like for four years but I couldn‚Äôt so I took this big step to ensure that I won‚Äôt regret anything later on.  Baqi physics concepts ki Jo baat hai idk about giki but in fast our teacher for applied physics went thru each and every concept of fsc again to make us understand so hopefully that will be the case in giki as well.

Also, for the clothes for now, take summer clothes and some clothes that you can wear in the mixed weather AND some hoodies and jackets too because it sometimes gets cold there like that. \nTake ur essentials, take a pillow or a cushion too (even tho they give you a pillow). You can get your groceries from there. You can get a mirror from there as well or bring it from home whatever you think is suitable for you.\nYou can take an iron and a kettle with you (thet give you a kettle too so it's not necessary). Heaters aren't allowed, they might allow or give a heater if it gets really cold. \nThat's all i can help you with rn",

    "selftext": "Congratulations to all of you who got admission to GIKI. Hope everyone is excited for the new journey. \nI've recently been reading everyone's concern about the lack of orientation efforts by the admin and students and I totally understand that, ngl mere Apne time mein bhi Kuch khas nae thi,  I personally can't do anything about this so I thought the least  I could do is share my experiences and lessons I learnt the hard way which maybe some of you could benefit from. \n\nPehle Kuch FAQs address kerlete Hein.\n- Hostels and campus life:\n                                             The hostels given to male freshmen are hostels 11 and 12. In hostels mein you have communal washrooms and each floor has two corridors jinke end per washrooms hotay on each side, don't worry you won't ever have to hold it for long üôÇ the cleanliness of the washroom depends on the people using those washrooms toh agar apki luck achi howi and you get people who care about hygiene toh you won't really have a problem and they do get cleaned regularly.\nThe room that you'll get allotted will have most of the basic stuff, a bed with a mattress and a pillow, a table that has a drawer with a lock, a shelf above the table and a medium sized wardrobe enough to hang and store your seasonal clothes and bags. Room mein radiators bhi hotay but mere time per they never turned on but I think that's changed now. You will probably need a small electric heater in the peak winter. You will have a roommate for the first two years, second year mein jab hostel change hongay toh you can ask for a specific roommate ofc.\nHostel keh second or fourth floor per common rooms hotay jinme AC chal raha hota and has a smoll tv too, so if you ever wanna chill between classes toh hostel ka common room is not the worst option.\nFor guys, laundry kayliye tuc per iek shop Hy Joh week mein 2-3 dafah laundry lene or dene atay, rates are normal but I would suggest keh humesha kapray dete Howe count your clothes cause kabhi kabhi lala sy kapray misplace hojatay, I have lost a few of my clothes that way ü•≤. You can get yourself surf and small tub to wash your socks and undergarments yourself too but uska itna time nae milta. \n\n- Food:\n            You get multiple options for food which are okay honestly. Mainly you get 3 options\nUnlike Nust and some other universities, apka Mess isn't in the hostel itself, you need to go the central Mess that isn't really far. Mess ka khanay is okay, you won't probably like it shuru mein cause it's a huge shift in taste but it is relatively cheaper, do make sure to keep a proper record of your mess attendance, apko iek register per mess In ya out kerna hotay, just take a picture of that page in case you ever need it in the future cause mess Walay aksar charge you extra meals. You get charged separately for breakfast and lunch or dinner iek Sath hotay.\nYou won't get charged for breakfast if you don't do it even if apka Mess in Hy. Lunch or dinner mein sy kek bhi agar ap kerte toh you'll get charged for both. Mess in or out ap mostly kabhi bhi kersaktay but Kuch din jab menu mein koi ayesi chez ho which is served a specific quantity per person, us din apko timely in kerna hota, if I'm not wrong before 10 am. Baqi mess keh rules and policies lala explain kerdenge. It's a good/okay option overall.\nSecond option is the Giki-Cafe which is below the auditorium, food there is good and prices are okay as well, you can get thoray bohat snacks as well from there. The only downside to it is keh at rush hours it's hard to find a place there ya phir the food is finished lekin if you come at a good time toh you would probably never face these issues.\nThird option tuc Hy and tuc ka Khana is good but it a little expensive sometimes. The fast food is not the best but it's not bad either. Plenty of options to explore. \n\n- Academic life:\n                           Most probably ap giki perhne kayliye hi arahay so let's go over some basic things overall perhayi keh lihaz sy. One of the biggest differences for me was keh there's a huge difference between semester system and annual, most probably abhi tak you went through your matric/fsc and O/A levels jisme if u didn't study shuru mein toh ap aksar chezin cover kerlete thay end mein. Semesters are not like that, it's just 4 months that pass by really quick, after the first two months Apke mids hongay and then two months after that finals and I'm between quizzes or assignments which all contribute to your grade. You also get a project depending on the course after the mids which counts for your grade as well, I'll try to attach a general breakdown of the weightage of everything but it's varies from instructor to instructor, they'll share everything during the first week.\nThe easiest way to get a good gpa is to make sure you put in the effort shuru sy, make sure you get good marks in your quizzes and assignments. Assignments har koi aksar copy kerta lekin if you try to do it yourself and on time toh Apke quiz ki tayari bhi hojati cause assignments keh Baad aksar ussi syllabus ka quiz hota. Agar apke quizzes or assignments achay jarahay Hein toh eventually you'll get good marks in the mids and the finals.\nRelative grading might be a new thing to a lot of students, and it's not really a bad thing. In a nutshell, your marks can be considered good if you are above the average marks scored in that exam/quiz, which obviously means you scored more than most of the people. Apne Koshish yeh kerni keh you don't fall below the average ever. The position relatively to your entire class is what determines your grade for the course and also depends a bit on the nature of the instructor keh woh Kesi grading kerte. \nOverall agar perhayi mein apko koi masla ata Hy toh I would suggest to respectfully approach your instructor at a suitable time and address them the issues you're facing, koi Orr student apko us Tarah guide nahi kersakta and not everyone wants to as well.\nMost instructors are nice enough to help you out. \nTry not to miss your quizzes and submit your assignments on time, assignments keh free keh number hotay so don't waste that extra 2-4%.\nTry your best to get a good gpa In your first two semesters kiunke Baad mein it's relatively hard to improve your cgpa...\nEach course has a specific number of credit hours allotted to it.\nThe allowed number of absentees depend on the credit hours, you're allowed 9,6,3 absentees for a 3,2,1 credit hour course respectively. I'm not gonna get in the details but a higher credit hour course has a greater weightage on your grade as well so prioritize getting a good grade in the 3 credit hour courses cause they can make and break your gpa. Baqi try to make sure you exceed the allowed absentees for your course, some instructors don't mind a few extra absentees but it's best you stay within the allowed limit warna you won't be allowed to sit in the final exam of that course and you could say goodbye to getting a good grade.\nBaqi personally I would suggest keh instructors ki good books mein raho, it won't make a huge difference in any way lekin apko potentially faida bhi hosakta Hy in a lot of ways.\n\nAlso try to setup your profile on LinkedIn as well, keep it updated. It's a good professional platform that will help you in the longer run.\n\n\n- Ragging:\n                 Speaking from a guy's perspective, ragging giki mein hoti Hy seedhi baat Hy, 90% of the time the seniors doing the ragging, do it to break the ice. It's not a Bad thing honestly. No one will ask you to do anything physical at any public place, seniors keh rooms jaoge toh alag baat Hy and whatever happens there could range from measuring the floor using a coin to limits you don't wanna know. \nMy advice would be to be respectful to your seniors no matter what as long as they don't force you to do anything ya get physical. Agar koi masla ho toh just walk away and report it to the admin.\nFor some societies, apko join kerne kayliye you have to give an informal interview which is another name for ragging. \nIt really depends on how far are you willing to go or apki boundaries kia Hein. One of the good things about ragging is keh seniors Khana khila dete ragging keh Baad aksar üòÄ.\nBaqi mein zayada nae Bata raha kiunke mene khud bhi kerni Hy üòâ.\n\n\nNow a few personal suggestions from my experiences over the two years I've spent here. Yeh baatein saari subjective hongi and depend on the sorta person you are.\n\n- Hostel life is not easy, it's necessary for every adult imo, apko ab tak ghar per Joh comfort Mila that all is gonna change, now as an adult you'll be responsible for your diet, laundry, studies, hygiene, social life, entertainment etc. Make sure to use this opportunity to grow as a responsible adult.\n- Societies and teams: you'll get bombarded with a lot of seniors iek time per who'll try to convince you to join their societies cause uske beaghair ap kia hi keroge in that jungle, that's not entirely false lekin you could do a lot with a couple of good friends. Society ka iek faida yeh Hy keh apka Apne batchmates or seniors keh Sath iek acha social circle banjata and it's an easy way toh build a social circle. Baqi koi khas faida nae, it's mostly stupid kaam and zalalat. But again it's entirely up to the sort of person you are and what your priorities are. For some people,  societies end up ruining their academic life but for some Joh smartly manage kerte sab it's doesn't really effect them.\nSocieties ka future mein Kuch khas faida nae, no recruiter is gonna look at your CV and think \"is banday ny society ka event acha kerwaya tha toh islye isko nokri dedun\". Yes sure it does help you build a better personality and build your people-skills but it's nothing you can't learn in other ways. What would actually benefit you are teams, join a team relevant to your faculty and Usme you'll get much more knowledge, experience and even opportunities.\n\nI tried to keep it short and to the point lekin clearly I failed, if you have any other questions ya concerns toh feel free to ask.\nP.S I'm not an expert, everything I wrote was solely based on my experiences.

I while studying in Giki got fully funded Master‚Äôs by research offers abroad as well as jobs overseas with relocation support, so trust me, the opportunities are there. Giki Alumni network is very strong and the name is very good even out of Pakistan.\n\nGIKI hostel life is also way better in my opinion. I‚Äôve seen the hostels, mess, and overall environment of both GIKI and LUMS, and I preferred GIKI by far. LUMS has a lot of day scholars, while GIKI is entirely on-campus, so you get that full university experience.\n\nAlmost 90% graduates of Giki‚Äôs FCSE got job after one month of graduation while others opted for master‚Äôs abroad, so the job placement is very high.\n\nIf you‚Äôre from Lahore and plan to live at home, then LUMS could make sense. But in my case, I had to stay in a hostel, and I chose GIKI ‚Äì never regretted it for a moment.\n\nIf you have any other concerns you may reply, I would love to guide.",

Academics are great, exposure is great too. \n\nGIKI is a tougher ball game. But what it teaches you is how to handle tough experiences. The societies are great, the bond you share is life long even with those who graduated before your time when you enter the real world. \n\nWhether you're looking to stay here or go abroad, how it plays depends totally on your own approach to your uni years.

I am in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and here I have organized a Giki alumni meetup in Riyadh today and there are attendees from natch 1 to batch 30. As far as the activities on campus are considered, there are concerts and events on almost every weekend. There are coding competitions, sports events, we have great cricket team if you are into cricket. A great basketball team of girls and boys. we have sports matches inside Giki and also with other universities and Alhamdulillah we won against many other institutes. The societies are very active, do try to get into multiple societies.  Giki is near to northern areas you can easily go to northern areas with friends or on society trips.

Me and my friend started to look out for unis to find which one is best for cs. Wrote every uni in lahore and at the end left with fast and itu. Fast me admission hoa ni itu ka dia ni. Dimagh me yhi tha ke lahore se to bahir nhi jana or hostel life bhi ni reh layein ge. In short, lack of exposure and counseling. Phr kuch research ke baad options samne aye ke umt ya ucp. Umt me hogya or ucp me abhi result ana h. Baat yh ha keh ik GIKi is a better uni then ucp and umt wagera but i didnt submitted my application in giki or ab agr mjhe GIK janey ke liye gap lena pre ga.

Many even follow it up with a welcome party or some sort of celebration. It really sets the tone for the rest of their university life.\n\nGIKI is charging us a massive amount in tuition expenses, but when it comes to organizing something welcoming or meaningful for new students, there‚Äôs literally nothing official. I get that there are concerts, qawalis, and sometimes raves later on... but let‚Äôs be real not everyone is into music events or night gigs. Some people prefer interactive games, orientation talks, casual social hangouts, and other ways to connect.\n\nThere should be something inclusive enough to cater to all kinds of students not just the ones who enjoy loud music and concerts. A thoughtful welcome doesn‚Äôt require a massive budget, just some genuine effort.\n\nThere should at least be a proper welcome event... Even mid-tier universities manage to pull that off.\n\nAnyone else feel the same?",

        "body": "What should you bring to GIKI\n\nWhat to Bring to GIKI\n\n\r\nEssentials List\n\n\r\nThis list is meant for things that are non-negotiable\n\n\r\n1.\tBedsheets\n\n\r\nBring at least 2 bedsheets. GIKI gives you a mattress and a mattress cover, but the bedsheets are on you.\n\n\r\n2.\tPillow Cover\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll get a pillow from GIKI, but not the cover. Bring one or two of your own.\n\n\r\n3.\tBlanket/Chadar\n\n\r\nYou will have 1 week break after mids to get stuff for Winters. No need to bring at the start. You will also need Electric Blower in winter, but November me le ana when you get mid break.\n\n\r\n4.\tToiletries\n\n\r\nThe basics like soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste. Stay clean and fresh. Can be bought from inside GIK.\n\n\r\n5.\tTowels\n\n\r\nOne hand towel and one bath towel. Using one towel for everything isn't a flex. Just bring both.\n\n\r\n6.\tWater Bottle\n\n\r\nA vacuum flask bottle is a good idea. Saves you from running to the water dispenser every time you're thirsty. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n7.\tBug Spray\n\n\r\nYou will need this. Mortein or Kingtox, your choice. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n8.\tUmbrella\n\n\r\nGet a white or silver-colored one. It‚Äôll help in both sun and rain. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n9.\tCleaning Cloth\n\n\r\nUseful when you spill tea, coffee or anything else on your desk.\n\n\r\n10.\tLaptop\n\n\r\nGo for at least an 8th gen i5 or i7 with 8GB RAM. An SSD makes a big difference if you can afford one. This is the minimum. You can go higher if you want.\n\n\r\n11.\tPhone Charger\n\n\r\nObvious but easy to forget. Don‚Äôt leave it behind.\n\n\r\n12.\tRucksack or Backpack\n\n\r\nPerfect for carrying snacks from TUC to your room without making it obvious. Also works for books if you decide to study.\n\n\r\n13.\tLaundry Basket or Bucket\n\n\r\nSomething to throw dirty clothes in. I used a bucket and washed socks in it too. Don‚Äôt use your chair for laundry or you‚Äôll have nowhere to sit. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n14.\tNail cutter\n\n\r\nNakhun kaatne ke liye yes\n\n\r\n15.\tStapler\n\n\r\nVery important. Bring a stapler, get extra pins, and keep them stocked.\n\n\r\n16.\tHangers\n\n\r\nHelps when you wake up at 7:50 for a class at 8:00. Just grab the hanged clothes, pitstop at the bathroom and rush to class.\n\n\r\n17.\tTissues\n\n\r\nUseful for all kinds of situations. You can always steal some from the mess or TUC, but better to keep your own incase you need them at night or hours when they are closed.\n\n\r\n18.\tSnacks\n\n\r\nMidnight cravings hit hard. Especially when you are studying. I personally prefer biscuits. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n19.\tPrayer Mat\n\n\r\nNamaz parhna, acha grade aye ga.\n\n\r\n20.\tPlates, Cup, Glass, Utensils, Bowl\n\n\r\nYou won‚Äôt need these in the mess, but you will in your room when you're eating something on your own. \n\n\r\n21.\tDeodorant, Body Spray or Perfume\n\n\r\nSmelling nice makes a good impression. Don't skip this.\n\n\r\n22.\tSewing Kit\n\n\r\nIf your shirt tears, you‚Äôll have to fix it yourself. A small kit will help. Ab barey honey ka time aa geya he.\n\n\r\n23.\tDetergent (Small Pack)\n\r\nIn case something spills on your clothes, you can soak them quickly and avoid stains. Laundry service is available, but it is scheduled. Your clothes will get permanent stains until he comes. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n24.\tDishwashing Items\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll need to wash your own plates and cups. Bring a sponge and dish soap. Lemon max mera hero. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n25.\tCNIC and Registration Info\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll need these during check-in and formalities. Keep them safe.\n\n\r\n26.\tScissors\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll be surprised how often these come in handy. I even used them to fix my moustache the morning of my final presentation. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n27.\tKnife\n\n\r\nCan cut fruits, salads, ropes, people (don‚Äôt cut people 0/10 move highly unrecommended, 0 tolerance policy).\n\n\r\n28.\tSlippers\n\n\r\nSo you can slip in washroom (bad joke I know). Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n29.\tClothes\n\n\r\nThere‚Äôs no Dress code at GIKI but wear proper clothes. You‚Äôre not Tarzan. Can be bought from inside GIKI but I recommend that you bring your good clothes.\n\n\r\n30.\tMirror\n\n\r\nA small personal mirror helps you check your face before heading out.\n\n\r\n31.\tCalculator\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôre doing engineering. You know why this is important. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n32.\tElectric Kettle\n\n\r\nThis will save your life. Makes noodles, tea, coffee, boiled eggs and milk. Try to get one with a wide mouth. Narrow ones can be a pain. I know people who even tried to cook food in their kettle. I don‚Äôt know if they succeeded. But it is a true partner.\n\n\r\n33.\tElectric Iron\n\n\r\nDoes your clothes have wrinkles before an important meeting? This guy will help. Also used to heat food by students. You will learn the secret ways young pupil.\n\n\r\n34.\tOnline banking\n\n\r\nGet yourself an online bank account. Giki mein boht ziada use hota hai\n\n\r\n35.\tUFONE SIM\n\n\r\nIf possible, get yourself Ufone sim. Ufone works the best in GIK, ZONG ki service aksar down hoti hai. \n\n\r\n36.\tMedicines\n\n\r\nYou can get medicines from medical center here laikin basic medicines like Panadol, brufen,  arinac, etc. waise hi honi chahiye (laikin buntiyon ki tarah nahi khani). Also if you take any instructed medicine, wo lazmi rakh lena coz there‚Äôs a chance ke wo giki se na millein.\r\n\n\n\nCopied !",

    "selftext": "What are your thoughts on this ChatGPT Comparison?\n\nEntrance exams for GIKI, NUST, and FAST are all challenging, but each assesses different aspects of a student's abilities. Here's a breakdown:\n\nGIKI Admission Test\nFocus: Emphasizes conceptual understanding, problem-solving, and speed. Less about memorization, more about applying logic in Maths and Physics.\nStrength: Ideal for identifying students who excel at handling unfamiliar problems and thinking analytically ‚Äî similar to international standards like SAT Subject Tests or parts of the JEE.\nCalibre Measured: Deep analytical skills, raw intelligence, and time management under pressure.\n\nNUST NET\nFocus: Covers a wide range ‚Äî Maths, Physics, English, and Chemistry/CS (depending on the program). Includes both recall-based and reasoning questions.\nStrength: Good for evaluating a student's breadth of knowledge and ability to work quickly on familiar material. High volume of questions makes speed and accuracy essential.\nCalibre Measured: Retention, speed, and general academic preparation. Slightly less depth per question compared to GIKI.\n\nFAST Admission Test\nFocus: MCQ-based and typically shorter. Concentrates on fundamental concepts, often more straightforward than GIKI or NUST.\nStrength: Efficient at assessing whether students have a clear grasp of basics and can perform under time pressure.\nCalibre Measured: Solid foundation, quick thinking, and familiarity with the curriculum.\n\nWhich Test Best Measures Calibre?\nGIKI: Generally considered the toughest. Best for identifying students with strong analytical and conceptual abilities.\n\nNUST: Effective for testing overall academic preparation and stamina, with a mix of recall and reasoning.\n\nFAST: Reliable for checking basic understanding and quick thinking, though often seen as slightly easier than the other two.\n\nSummary\nRaw analytical thinking: GIKI > NUST ‚âà FAST\nBreadth and speed: NUST > FAST > GIKI\nBasics and foundation: FAST ‚âà NUST > GIKI",

I graduated in 2024 with AI degree and tbh studying at Giki was one of the best decisions of my life and I never regret it.

GIKI gives you a mattress and a mattress cover, but the bedsheets are on you.\n\n\r\n2.\tPillow Cover\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll get a pillow from GIKI, but not the cover. Bring one or two of your own.\n\n\r\n3.\tBlanket/Chadar\n\n\r\nYou will have 1 week break after mids to get stuff for Winters. No need to bring at the start. You will also need Electric Blower in winter, but November me le ana when you get mid break.\n\n\r\n4.\tToiletries\n\n\r\nThe basics like soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste. Stay clean and fresh. Can be bought from inside GIK.\n\n\r\n5.\tTowels\n\n\r\nOne hand towel and one bath towel. Using one towel for everything isn't a flex. Just bring both.\n\n\r\n6.\tWater Bottle\n\n\r\nA vacuum flask bottle is a good idea. Saves you from running to the water dispenser every time you're thirsty. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n7.\tBug Spray\n\n\r\nYou will need this. Mortein or Kingtox, your choice. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n8.\tUmbrella\n\n\r\nGet a white or silver-colored one. It‚Äôll help in both sun and rain. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n9.\tCleaning Cloth\n\n\r\nUseful when you spill tea, coffee or anything else on your desk.\n\n\r\n10.\tLaptop\n\n\r\nGo for at least an 8th gen i5 or i7 with 8GB RAM. An SSD makes a big difference if you can afford one. This is the minimum. You can go higher if you want.\n\n\r\n11.\tPhone Charger\n\n\r\nObvious but easy to forget. Don‚Äôt leave it behind.\n\n\r\n12.\tRucksack or Backpack\n\n\r\nPerfect for carrying snacks from TUC to your room without making it obvious. Also works for books if you decide to study.\n\n\r\n13.\tLaundry Basket or Bucket\n\n\r\nSomething to throw dirty clothes in. I used a bucket and washed socks in it too. Don‚Äôt use your chair for laundry or you‚Äôll have nowhere to sit. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n14.\tNail cutter\n\n\r\nNakhun kaatne ke liye yes\n\n\r\n15.\tStapler\n\n\r\nVery important. Bring a stapler, get extra pins, and keep them stocked.\n\n\r\n16.\tHangers\n\n\r\nHelps when you wake up at 7:50 for a class at 8:00. Just grab the hanged clothes, pitstop at the bathroom and rush to class.\n\n\r\n17.\tTissues\n\n\r\nUseful for all kinds of situations. You can always steal some from the mess or TUC, but better to keep your own incase you need them at night or hours when they are closed.\n\n\r\n18.\tSnacks\n\n\r\nMidnight cravings hit hard. Especially when you are studying. I personally prefer biscuits. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n19.\tPrayer Mat\n\n\r\nNamaz parhna, acha grade aye ga.\n\n\r\n20.\tPlates, Cup, Glass, Utensils, Bowl\n\n\r\nYou won‚Äôt need these in the mess, but you will in your room when you're eating something on your own. \n\n\r\n21.\tDeodorant, Body Spray or Perfume\n\n\r\nSmelling nice makes a good impression. Don't skip this.\n\n\r\n22.\tSewing Kit\n\n\r\nIf your shirt tears, you‚Äôll have to fix it yourself. A small kit will help. Ab barey honey ka time aa geya he.\n\n\r\n23.\tDetergent (Small Pack)\n\r\nIn case something spills on your clothes, you can soak them quickly and avoid stains. Laundry service is available, but it is scheduled. Your clothes will get permanent stains until he comes. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n24.\tDishwashing Items\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll need to wash your own plates and cups. Bring a sponge and dish soap. Lemon max mera hero. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n25.\tCNIC and Registration Info\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll need these during check-in and formalities. Keep them safe.\n\n\r\n26.\tScissors\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll be surprised how often these come in handy. I even used them to fix my moustache the morning of my final presentation. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n27.\tKnife\n\n\r\nCan cut fruits, salads, ropes, people (don‚Äôt cut people 0/10 move highly unrecommended, 0 tolerance policy).\n\n\r\n28.\tSlippers\n\n\r\nSo you can slip in washroom (bad joke I know). Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n29.\tClothes\n\n\r\nThere‚Äôs no Dress code at GIKI but wear proper clothes. You‚Äôre not Tarzan. Can be bought from inside GIKI but I recommend that you bring your good clothes.\n\n\r\n30.\tMirror\n\n\r\nA small personal mirror helps you check your face before heading out.\n\n\r\n31.\tCalculator\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôre doing engineering. You know why this is important. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n32.\tElectric Kettle\n\n\r\nThis will save your life. Makes noodles, tea, coffee, boiled eggs and milk. Try to get one with a wide mouth. Narrow ones can be a pain. I know people who even tried to cook food in their kettle. I don‚Äôt know if they succeeded. But it is a true partner.\n\n\r\n33.\tElectric Iron\n\n\r\nDoes your clothes have wrinkles before an important meeting? This guy will help. Also used to heat food by students. You will learn the secret ways young pupil.\n\n\r\n34.\tOnline banking\n\n\r\nGet yourself an online bank account. Giki mein boht ziada use hota hai\n\n\r\n35.\tUFONE SIM\n\n\r\nIf possible, get yourself Ufone sim. Ufone works the best in GIK, ZONG ki service aksar down hoti hai. \n\n\r\n36.\tMedicines\n\n\r\nYou can get medicines from medical center here laikin basic medicines like Panadol, brufen,  arinac, etc. waise hi honi chahiye (laikin buntiyon ki tarah nahi khani). Also if you take any instructed medicine, wo lazmi rakh lena coz there‚Äôs a chance ke wo giki se na millein.\r\n\n\n\nCopied !",

Laundry is very cheap thete, it costed me 500 rupees a month as while semester breaks I took the clothes home for laundry, that was 1 years ago. And they also ironed it for me. Though I had kept iron in my room but mostly I used it very less. Legally having iron in room is not allowed but tbh there are no rules in Giki Alhamdulillah.\n\nRest assured don‚Äôt worry!\n\nWill paste my comment in another post too here below‚Ä¶\n\nGiki is the best university in Pakistan. I graduated in 2024 and tbh studying at Giki was one of the best decisions of my life and I never regret it. During my final exams I was able to get scholarships and three job offer letters. The hostel life is very good and ragging is part of hostel life tbh. Ragging exists in every university of Pakistan but don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs also an integral part of Giki culture and I like it tbh. In my case I got ragging which was when I went to a senior room the first day I entered Giki so be like me don‚Äôt be afraid of ragging, the more you fear the more you will get tensed. Most likely, you will not suffer extreme ragging but if you suffer that, do not hesitate to complain to warden and dean of student affairs.",

Plus, GIKI‚Äôs alumni network is super strong and supportive....... People here genuinely help each other out.

But baat wohi aa jati hai Giki is an Engineering and Technology uni while Nust has a lot of social sciences, business and humanities programs. plus let‚Äôs not forget the high academic rigor in Giki. The on campus life is amazing in Giki and definitely better than Nust, but overall Nust life is a massive W because of location and the fact that you get time to relax, go to islamabad and stuff. So nust for the win in this case , unless there is something specific about Giki that you life , after all Giki is a very different uni and if you do enough research you‚Äôll get hooked onto one or many of it‚Äôs things.",

Hopefully, things will be better for you guys. Labs and overall infrastructure mei GIKI is better than EME. You could also argue GIKI is a bigger name than EME in industry.

The reason for sharing this? all of them are best as far as you actually want to learn and grow so yeahh from my experience i would suggest hashim zia fs his lectures and his marathons are very very good.\n\nThen physics with bilal zia he is also a great teacher and also other sub teachers are also good.\n\nplus in the last 10 days i bought net guide by dogars and kips kets 2025 there i was able to implement what i learned\n\npro tip: solve marathons yourself then see the solution it srsly gave alot of confidence",

I‚Äôve been selected in both Materials Engineering and Management Sciences, but I‚Äôm currently pursuing Management Sciences to stay on the safe side in case the transfer doesn‚Äôt work out.\n\nI‚Äôve heard that if you want to switch to a different school, especially to CS-related fields like AI, Cybersecurity, or Data Science, you need to take the entry test again. Is that true?\n\nAlso, what happens after the transfer? How are the foundation year courses managed, and how hard is it to get into those CS fields?\n\nWould appreciate any guidance. Thanks! \n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "***PLEASE EVERYONE UPVOTE SO IT COULD REACH TO MORE & MORE PEOPLE***:  \n  \nI‚Äôve been watching videos and reels of orientation weeks at NUST and LUMS, and honestly, I‚Äôm amazed they look so lively, fun, and exciting. They have proper orientation groups led by seniors, campus tours, batch photos, ice-breaking sessions, and all sorts of activities that help freshies feel at home right from day one. It really makes a difference when you‚Äôre new and nervous about starting university life.\n\nBut I‚Äôve heard from many people here that GIKI‚Äôs orientation is pretty dull and not enjoyable at all. Why can‚Äôt we change that? Why can‚Äôt our seniors and the student body work on making those first two days something memorable  something we can proudly talk about just like students at LUMS or NUST? A little fun and effort before classes start won‚Äôt hurt anyone; instead, it will set the tone for our whole experience at GIKI.\n\nIt‚Äôs not just about the orientation. Let‚Äôs be honest  when people choose LUMS or NUST over GIKI, it‚Äôs often because they see events, societies, and facilities that are more engaging and well-organized. We shouldn‚Äôt be left behind just because we don‚Äôt put enough effort into these things. As someone who will be joining GIKI this year, I really want our university to stand out in every possible way. Everyone wants to feel proud of their university  to see it at the top not just academically but also in terms of student life and campus culture.\n\n***I sincerely request our respected seniors and the Student Body Council to take this seriously and work on bringing positive changes. We freshies, and I‚Äôm sure many other students too, would wholeheartedly support any efforts to make orientation more exciting and student life more vibrant. Please make it your priority to bridge this gap between GIKI and other prestigious institutions like LUMS and IBA.***\n\nA few days of fun activities, better planning, and more student engagement won‚Äôt just benefit us  it will help future batches too and make GIKI an even more attractive choice for talented students. Seniors, we really look up to you please take immediate action and make this happen. Let‚Äôs make GIKI stand out for all the right reasons!",

Let‚Äôs be honest when people choose LUMS or NUST over GIKI, it‚Äôs often because they see events, societies, and facilities that are more engaging and well-organized. We shouldn‚Äôt be left behind just because we don‚Äôt put enough effort into these things. As someone who will be joining GIKI this year, I really want our university to stand out in every possible way. Everyone wants to feel proud of their university to see it at the top not just academically but also in terms of student life and campus culture.\n\n***I sincerely request (our respected seniors and the Student Body Council)to take this seriously and work on bringing positive changes. We freshies, and I‚Äôm sure many other students too, would wholeheartedly support any efforts to make orientation more exciting and student life more vibrant. Please make it your priority to bridge this gap between GIKI and other prestigious institutions like LUMS and IBA.***\n\nA few days of fun activities, better planning, and more student engagement won‚Äôt just benefit us it will help future batches too and make GIKI an even more attractive choice for talented students. Seniors, we really look up to you  please take immediate action and make this happen.

Generally,according to universities ranking in Pakistan LUMS is first, IBA second, and GIKI stands at third, with NUST usually just behind. One big plus at GIKI is that most of the faculty have done their degrees abroad, so the exposure and teaching quality is [solid.You](http://solid.You) might‚Äôve heard about some professors leaving, but it‚Äôs not as big an issue as people make it sound good faculty do come and go everywhere, and GIKI still maintains a high standard. Plus, the environment, campus life, and opportunities you‚Äôll get there ( especially with a scholarship ) are worth it.\n\nSo if you‚Äôre comfortable living in Swabi too, I‚Äôd pick GIKI.

I started prepping for the NET after my cies so I'd say about a month and a half.¬† Actually gave the GIKI test as a backup if it didn't go as expected. I completed oetp and the kips books for both physics and maths with a special emphasis on certain high weightage chapters. Doing the practise books is non negotiable even if its tedious if you want a good score. The test itself is 80 marks and you get 2 hours. You'd also benefit from not only memorising the \"short tricks\" but knowing whats actually going on when solving questions. You should try giving the net 1 in december for practise sake and if you score well there you'd definitely score good for the giki one.¬†\n\n\nAs for the scholarship I believe it is 100 percent if you get a top 20 merit position in your applied major. Only for tuition tho (to my knowledge) so stuff like food and hostel bills are charged.¬†\nGoodluck",

For CS, LUMS is usually considered the gold standard because of its strong CS faculty and research. IBA‚Äôs CS program is well-respected too, especially in Karachi. GIKI has always had a strong brand name for engineering and computing, especially because it stays very focused  the grads usually do really well in software houses, startups, and big tech.  \nNUST is also great and big on marketing itself as No.1 in Pakistan  \n( as u said about the boasting stuff...I also went for the NET and they did the same as u mentioned)   \n which is true in some areas like engineering disciplines overall and international rankings (like QS rankings), but for CS specifically, people still generally rank LUMS first, then IBA/GIKI, and then NUST. It‚Äôs not a huge gap though NUST CS is still respected, especially because of its Islamabad location and large alumni base.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to where you‚Äôll get the better experience and value for your effort. With GIKI‚Äôs scholarship, strong reputation, and focused environment, you will be surrounded by motivated students and good opportunities, you really can‚Äôt go wrong with GIKI  that‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm going too!  \nP.S I had relatives studied from GIKI and since childhood I have been hearing the names LUMS,IBA and GIKI.......NUST is a recent addition.Well i won't force u to take a decision that you don't prefer but as a brother I just wanted to guide you.....  \nREST ITS UP TO YOU!",

I like being clean and organized but im not overly obsessed with it(appearently thats the first thing people wanna know about their potential roommates). I dont mind constructive criticism, infact i encourage it, so like if im overstepping any boundaries or being difficult(altho i try to be considerate), just lmk i will try to improve. Im definitely gonna have a social life in giki so consider me extroverted, But for me CGPA is gonna be 1st priority so. Im a clean shave kind of guy (in my opinion it tells you alot about a person). Robotics and Football is about 80 percent of my personality. I cook sometimes but obviously i cant in giki. Im a little into gaming but it isnt a part of my personality i just play sometimes.\n\nNow for what i look in a roommate, for the most part i just want my roommate to be a positive and considerate guy. I want him to be well groomed. I want him to be composed and have control on his emotions, and dont mind constructive criticism from me either. And ofc that we vibe. Baki i just mentioned all my hobbies so it would be amazing if u match interests with me.\n\nEven if we cant be roommates for some reason id love to start talking with my classmates and batchmates.\n",

That‚Äôs a big achievement already, and you should be proud of yourself for making it this far.  \nAbout what you read on Reddit please don‚Äôt let a few random negative posts shake your confidence. It‚Äôs very common for students everywhere to complain online when they‚Äôre frustrated. But remember, GIKI has a strong reputation and a name that is respected across Pakistan and even abroad. It‚Äôs one of the top engineering and management institutions in the country, with a good alumni network working in big companies and even running their own businesses. As for the professors not taking lectures properly of course, the experience can vary from course to course, just like anywhere else. Some teachers are excellent, some are average can be seen everywhere.  \n( I am not talking specifically about GIKI Iam talking about every school or university),  \n But at the end of the day, your own effort matters the most. If you stay focused, do your assignments, and use the resources around you, you‚Äôll come out with a solid foundation.\n\nManagement Sciences as a degree has a lot of value in the corporate world. It opens doors in marketing, HR, finance, supply chain, consulting, project management and many other fields. Many top managers, CEOs, and business analysts have a background in Management Sciences or Business Administration. Companies always need smart people who understand how to manage people, money, and processes in the right way.\n\nSo please don‚Äôt believe every rumor you see online. Talk to seniors, ask your professors questions, join societies  the more effort you put in, the more you‚Äôll get out of GIKI. Take a deep breath and trust your decision  you‚Äôre going to do great! Plus get the most out of the GIK experience.",

    "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI‚Äôm currently holding a **provisional offer for BS Cyber Security** with a **merit number of 720ish**, and I‚Äôm trying to **switch to Software Engineering (BCSW)** before the **Aug 5 deadline**.\n\nI‚Äôve already sent an email to admissions a few days ago ‚Äî no response yet. I even mentioned my merit number and eligibility clearly. Now I‚Äôm stuck in this limbo where I don‚Äôt know whether to wait it out or just pay the fee for Cyber and risk getting locked into a program I don‚Äôt want.\n\nI‚Äôve seen random Reddit threads from past years, but no one seems to explain what actually *happened next*.\n\n* Did anyone get a successful program switch after provisional offer?\n* Did they reply by email or silently change your portal?\n* Should I just call them? WhatsApp? Go full Pakistan-mode? üò≠\n\nIf you‚Äôve been through this or know someone who has, please help a bhai out. I don‚Äôt want to end up in Cyber with no way out.",

Whereas, BS Management Sciences (GIKI) is More general ‚Äî covers business, marketing, finance, HR, and entrepreneurship as well as economics. Now about coming from a pre med background, i don‚Äôt really know how that feels but someone who had Economics as one of their subjects in A levels, I would say that Economics at NUST may involve a lot more math, especially in the first few semesters since I have heard that in the first 2 years you study a slightly advanced version of what you learned in A levels. However, Management Sciences at GIKI might be slightly easier to transition into because it‚Äôs more business-oriented and less math-heavy at the start you can get easily used to it. And that is why I chose GIKI",

Isn‚Äôt it better to stay with your parents?‚Äù\n\nHere‚Äôs the twist:\nMy home environment used to be tense. Things weren‚Äôt very happy or peaceful. But recently, everything‚Äôs gotten better. The family vibe is finally warm ‚Äî everyone‚Äôs happy, we‚Äôre talking, laughing, just being good. And now I‚Äôm stuck thinking‚Ä¶ is it okay to move away when finally something you've been longing for has happened?\n\nGIKI obviously has more prestige and that full campus experience, but ITU is also not that bad, and I‚Äôd be in Lahore, with family, friends, and familiar surroundings. My parents aren‚Äôt stopping me, but I can feel the subtle pressure from relatives.\n\nShould I go chase independence and growth at GIKI?\nOr should I stay in Lahore at ITU, close to the people I love, now that things are finally healing?\n\nWould appreciate advice, personal stories, anything.\n\n",

I know all the ifs and buts and the basics of the situation and I am inclined towards NUST honestly because I am aware of the labs that are available and the faculty is okay‚Äôish, which works for me. While fees is a factor, it will be managed. The main issue is the hostel situation at NUST, and I don‚Äôt want the hassle that gets into that. So finally, I would really appreciate if someone credible can let me know about their experience in GIKI, since that‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt want to miss out nor do I have enough information to form a final opinion. \n\nSecondly, I don‚Äôt know how the first year hostels are in GIK either honestly for someone around 1500mp.\n\nTLDR: Do EE seniors recommend EE from GIKI.",

    "selftext": "This is not as easy as you think but is doable. Here are a few things that you should take care of in first 2 semesters in giki. \n\n1. Never take any quiz, assignment for granted. Students don't learn for first quizzes and submit assignments late. But each quiz, each assignment is significant for final grade. \n\n2. Don't rely on mid term and finals for good grades. Yes they have a good weightage but don't take other things non seriously. \n\n3. Be disciplined in hostel life. Since many of us never stayed in hostel, it can be a liberating experience with no one to tell you what to do. For first semester, make sure you follow a good balanced schedule and revise lectures everyday. DO PLAY PHYSICAL SPORTS. It is free in GIKI so do play sports.  At least 1 hour per day. Similarly try to be hygenic in a sharing room. \n\n4. Limit Screen time (non educational). Its totally fine to watch tv shows, dramas and what not but limit the screen time and distractions. Remember. Your first job at giki is to study. Everything else is secondary. \n\n5. Focus on diet, mental health and sleep. If you are unable to follow proper diet plan, make sure you eat from mess. Yes it is a set scheduled meal but it is usually balanced and will take the hassle of thinking what to eat each day out of your hands. After some months, you'll get a hold of everything \n\n6. Societies and events are big attraction but can end up taking alot of time. Don't indulge into societies until at least 2nd semester. Enjoy events on the weekend though. Again nothing matters if your GPA is not good. \n\n7. Your semester's performance (SGPA) should always be higher than your cumulative gpa (CGPA). If you don't know the difference, JUST REMEMBER THIS RULE for now. Later on you'll get to know how to calculate it etc. \n\n",

        "body": "What should you bring to GIKI\n\nWhat to Bring to GIKI\n\n\r\nEssentials List\n\n\r\nThis list is meant for things that are non-negotiable\n\n\r\n1.\tBedsheets\n\n\r\nBring at least 2 bedsheets. GIKI gives you a mattress and a mattress cover, but the bedsheets are on you.\n\n\r\n2.\tPillow Cover\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll get a pillow from GIKI, but not the cover. Bring one or two of your own.\n\n\r\n3.\tBlanket/Chadar\n\n\r\nYou will have 1 week break after mids to get stuff for Winters. No need to bring at the start. You will also need Electric Blower in winter, but November me le ana when you get mid break.\n\n\r\n4.\tToiletries\n\n\r\nThe basics like soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste. Stay clean and fresh. Can be bought from inside GIK.\n\n\r\n5.\tTowels\n\n\r\nOne hand towel and one bath towel. Using one towel for everything isn't a flex. Just bring both.\n\n\r\n6.\tWater Bottle\n\n\r\nA vacuum flask bottle is a good idea. Saves you from running to the water dispenser every time you're thirsty. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n7.\tBug Spray\n\n\r\nYou will need this. Mortein or Kingtox, your choice. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n8.\tUmbrella\n\n\r\nGet a white or silver-colored one. It‚Äôll help in both sun and rain. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n9.\tCleaning Cloth\n\n\r\nUseful when you spill tea, coffee or anything else on your desk.\n\n\r\n10.\tLaptop\n\n\r\nGo for at least an 8th gen i5 or i7 with 8GB RAM. An SSD makes a big difference if you can afford one. This is the minimum. You can go higher if you want.\n\n\r\n11.\tPhone Charger\n\n\r\nObvious but easy to forget. Don‚Äôt leave it behind.\n\n\r\n12.\tRucksack or Backpack\n\n\r\nPerfect for carrying snacks from TUC to your room without making it obvious. Also works for books if you decide to study.\n\n\r\n13.\tLaundry Basket or Bucket\n\n\r\nSomething to throw dirty clothes in. I used a bucket and washed socks in it too. Don‚Äôt use your chair for laundry or you‚Äôll have nowhere to sit. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n14.\tNail cutter\n\n\r\nNakhun kaatne ke liye yes\n\n\r\n15.\tStapler\n\n\r\nVery important. Bring a stapler, get extra pins, and keep them stocked.\n\n\r\n16.\tHangers\n\n\r\nHelps when you wake up at 7:50 for a class at 8:00. Just grab the hanged clothes, pitstop at the bathroom and rush to class.\n\n\r\n17.\tTissues\n\n\r\nUseful for all kinds of situations. You can always steal some from the mess or TUC, but better to keep your own incase you need them at night or hours when they are closed.\n\n\r\n18.\tSnacks\n\n\r\nMidnight cravings hit hard. Especially when you are studying. I personally prefer biscuits. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n19.\tPrayer Mat\n\n\r\nNamaz parhna, acha grade aye ga.\n\n\r\n20.\tPlates, Cup, Glass, Utensils, Bowl\n\n\r\nYou won‚Äôt need these in the mess, but you will in your room when you're eating something on your own. \n\n\r\n21.\tDeodorant, Body Spray or Perfume\n\n\r\nSmelling nice makes a good impression. Don't skip this.\n\n\r\n22.\tSewing Kit\n\n\r\nIf your shirt tears, you‚Äôll have to fix it yourself. A small kit will help. Ab barey honey ka time aa geya he.\n\n\r\n23.\tDetergent (Small Pack)\n\r\nIn case something spills on your clothes, you can soak them quickly and avoid stains. Laundry service is available, but it is scheduled. Your clothes will get permanent stains until he comes. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n24.\tDishwashing Items\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll need to wash your own plates and cups. Bring a sponge and dish soap. Lemon max mera hero. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n25.\tCNIC and Registration Info\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll need these during check-in and formalities. Keep them safe.\n\n\r\n26.\tScissors\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôll be surprised how often these come in handy. I even used them to fix my moustache the morning of my final presentation. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n27.\tKnife\n\n\r\nCan cut fruits, salads, ropes, people (don‚Äôt cut people 0/10 move highly unrecommended, 0 tolerance policy).\n\n\r\n28.\tSlippers\n\n\r\nSo you can slip in washroom (bad joke I know). Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n29.\tClothes\n\n\r\nThere‚Äôs no Dress code at GIKI but wear proper clothes. You‚Äôre not Tarzan. Can be bought from inside GIKI but I recommend that you bring your good clothes.\n\n\r\n30.\tMirror\n\n\r\nA small personal mirror helps you check your face before heading out.\n\n\r\n31.\tCalculator\n\n\r\nYou‚Äôre doing engineering. You know why this is important. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n32.\tElectric Kettle\n\n\r\nThis will save your life. Makes noodles, tea, coffee, boiled eggs and milk. Try to get one with a wide mouth. Narrow ones can be a pain. I know people who even tried to cook food in their kettle. I don‚Äôt know if they succeeded. But it is a true partner.\n\n\r\n33.\tElectric Iron\n\n\r\nDoes your clothes have wrinkles before an important meeting? This guy will help. Also used to heat food by students. You will learn the secret ways young pupil.\n\n\r\n34.\tOnline banking\n\n\r\nGet yourself an online bank account. Giki mein boht ziada use hota hai\n\n\r\n35.\tUFONE SIM\n\n\r\nIf possible, get yourself Ufone sim. Ufone works the best in GIK, ZONG ki service aksar down hoti hai. \n\n\r\n36.\tMedicines\n\n\r\nYou can get medicines from medical center here laikin basic medicines like Panadol, brufen,  arinac, etc. waise hi honi chahiye (laikin buntiyon ki tarah nahi khani). Also if you take any instructed medicine, wo lazmi rakh lena coz there‚Äôs a chance ke wo giki se na millein.",

Matlab agar CS ka Plan confirmed hai then ankh band Kar Kar Lums jao. If you don‚Äôt want to do CS then depends on what u wanna do. ME ka plan hai to just come to GIKI. Yahan ki ME is just better than literally every mechanical dept in this country (and yes including NUST aswell). EE both giki and Lums mein offer hoti hoti. Both are really nice, agar EE ka plan banta hai then dekhlo Kay idk how good is EE at Lums. But Lums hai to achi to hogi. GIKI ki EE is also veryyyy good. I‚Äôd say SEECS jitna achi to hogi atleast. Grooming giki mein bhi hoti hai but, the grooming here is different than that of Lums. Yahan you‚Äôll find ppl from across the country from elistist families to even lower income families coming to study. What I think Lums is moreso like a bubble jahan ziada tar log eik hi tarah Kay hotay. Idk if ur from Lahore but if u are then Lums mein u won‚Äôt be having a hostel life. Yahan par obv you‚Äôll be having a very good hostel life aswell. Everyone stays on campus and genuinely telling from experience, it‚Äôs just a different lvl of experience that you‚Äôll have. Lums ki grooming is of a sort that you‚Äôll build more connections that are much useful that what u might make in giki. You‚Äôll have friends from elite families so that is a very good boost for ur career as well. Plus Lums ka alumni is stronger than that of GIKI. But GIKI kay alumni‚Äôs are much helpful than that of Lums (my opinion). So Dekhlo whichever suits u more. It‚Äôs not about which is better rather than it‚Äôs more of kay what will u like for urself. Hope this helps :)",

As for study abroad, Giki is also a good enough university with one of the best aids all over Pakistan and can get u a master's degree abroad (from top unis abroad) of course ur Ecs would matter. \n\nMy advise is if u wish to work here in Pakistan go for lums (as it has connections,sadly without connections you'd hardly get anywhere) but if u wanna go abroad go with either lums or giki won't matter. However since giki is a remote area, u might have a hard time for Ecs (like working outta city) but anything's possible if ur passionate.",

Ragging exists in every university of Pakistan but don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs also an integral part of Giki culture and I like it tbh. In my case I got ragging which was when I went to a senior room the first day I entered Giki so be like me don‚Äôt be afraid of ragging, the more you fear the more you will get tensed. Most likely, you will not suffer extreme ragging but if you suffer that, do not hesitate to complain to warden and dean of student affairs.",

Sure, you can still explore other CS fields regardless of your major, but you won‚Äôt benefit much from a Cyber degree if you decide to switch paths after graduation.\n\nThat said, Cybersecurity itself offers a wide range of roles to choose from, and if you stick with it and put in the time, you can absolutely succeed.\nThe main concern, though, is that Cyber at GIKI doesn‚Äôt have strong faculty‚Äîjust 2 or 3 mediocre teachers at best‚Äîso you‚Äôll largely be on your own.\n\nSame applies to Data Science.

Giki is honestly behind on this part. But even if you go to iqra, you can go to harvard if you have good projects and extracurriculars that combine with your gpa to form an exceptional story. It will be easiest to get a good gpa at iqrA.",

        "body": "1. Kettle if you are a tea or coffee drinker\n2. Basic cutlery set like plates spoons glasses mugs etc\n3. Have water containers even if it‚Äôs small in size just to store water from coolers placed on each floor as it would be tedious to drink again and again from coolers\n4. Iron for ironing clothes \n5. Bring two sets of your shampoo toothpaste or body wash etc if you use a special brand‚Ä¶ or else you can order from an online site (yes we do have online delivery like TCS service here in giki)\n6. Laundry basket and surf if you‚Äôre planning to do laundry in hostel ( we do have washing machines in all girls hostels) tho we do have a dhobi ghaat here which washes and irons your clothes (yes it‚Äôs priced but not very high)\n7. Lunch boxes or containers to store extra food\n8. Vim and lemon max to wash crockery \n9. Med kit is a must; have basic medicine to treat fever cold and flu. Yes you can get free medicine from medical center upon dr rec after checkup but just in case you should have panadol if you are prone to migraine\n10. For sanitary wear, ‚Äúalways‚Äù brand is available in tuc, last time I checked. If you use a different brand, bring it with you or you can order it online\n11. Umbrella is a BIG MUST and yes you will need in summers even in September and October. You‚Äôll be walking a lot between different faculties for your classes and that too under scorching heat üò≠ so umbrella will give you a lot of shade and comfort while walking \n12. Obviously your school bag or purse that should have water bottle, umbrella your notebook etc \n13. You won‚Äôt survive without water bottle or stanley cup (whatever suits you), trust me especially in first few weeks when walking to classes so make sure you have it with you.\n14. Sunblock is a must here. Have cap and then again umbrella cuz one could easily get tan here\n15. There‚Äôs a small beauty parlour here for threading and waxing tho \n16. Keep a USB with you, just in case\n17. Pamphlet or file holder to keep your important docs \n18. Keep an extension lead, another must have\n19. Sets of bedsheets pillows and towels and a bucket \n20. Stationary Warna you can get it from tuc\n21. For snacking, you can bring your own if you want to but here at tuc we even have buldak noodles, nom nachos etc \n22. Every floor has 2 fridges and microwaves‚Ä¶ if you want to bring home food, you can store it in fridges and freezers like k&ns etc or frozen meals but make sure to write your name in containers you are keeping it (trust me, your fellow freshies will steal your food tho üòÖ)\n23. And a secure wallet to store your id card, debit/credit and student card and money too. And keep that wallet in your bag with you always whenever you are going to classes. Yes your cupboards will have locks (if it isn‚Äôt faulty) and you can keep it there too. \n\nWhen your student outlook account will be activated, you‚Äôll daily see a lost and found email that xyz student has lost their credit card, money or phone so yeah hold tightly onto your things",

I've paid the admission, tuition and semester fee there which is quite a hefty amount. Now I wanna secure my seat for GIKI until my result comes out. Do i have to pay the semester 6 lac or the annual 10 lac. If I meet the conditions of the other uni and decide to opt for that, how much of my giki fee will be refunded? What's the best plan of action for me now? Plsplspls guide!! thanku <33",

The facilities are nice, there's a free gym and a higher tier 500 rs a month gym. The pool i kinda hate since it's only open May-September and is a bit overcrowded. Mess food is good for the first month then it gets worse over time, costs however much days you eat. There are 3 major restaurants, nothing branded but yeah. Crumbl left last year, but the shop that made them now make their own under another name which are just as nice imo.",

I should have believed myself at that time, i could have taken the test seriously so i could get top 20 scholarship. i wish i could join GIKI(my dream university) this year. Maybe God has better plans. Anyways leaving the Seat for my fella!  Peeps who didn't get in, trust me there is something better waiting for u. ",

However, I‚Äôm fairly certain that I‚Äôll get into Mechanical or Civil Engineering at NUST in the second or third merit list. The issue is that the deadline to pay the fee at GIKI is 5th August, which is before the NUST second and third merit lists are expected to be released. To secure my spot at GIKI, I‚Äôve been asked to pay Rs. 623,000. Is there any way around this? Can I secure my admission by only paying the admission fee and security deposit, or do I have to pay the full semester fee as well?",
